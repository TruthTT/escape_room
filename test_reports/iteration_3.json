The room creation form submits but does not navigate to the lobby/room page, preventing users from accessing the game. This blocks testing of all the new features: keyboard controls (WASD/arrows), virtual joystick, and new puzzle modals (Clock, Slider, Color Mix, Book Cipher). The backend APIs are working perfectly, so this is a frontend routing/navigation issue. Check the room creation success handler and navigation logic in the React components.",
